## Description 

A redesigned and upgraded PONG video game which includes more features and visual effects.



## Highlights 

Compared to the original PONG game, I added:

- Real physics engine 
- Start and Mode menu
- Colorful flame

- Functional items
- Four paddles for Four players
- And more and more fun things for you to discover

## Tech

  - Group, Animate, Canvas and so on
- CSS — for colorful and visual effects
  - Transitions and so on



## Future improvement
- Setting

  Now all the setting such as the speed or the number of the balls can only be changed in code. I am going to add a setting for the game so that user can set many variables such as the number of balls and speeds on their own.

  

- Server

  It will be more fun to put this game on the server since two players on different computers can play with each other. I am going to use Node.js to achieve the server. 

  

- AI 

  Adding AI can let you play with the computer when alone; And you can experience the time trying to beat the computer. I am going to build different algorithms as the AI player and also set some diffcuilties like EASY, HARD and EXTERME.
